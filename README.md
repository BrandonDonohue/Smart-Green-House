# Smart-Green-House
Senior Design Project 2: **Smart Green House**

This was the second part of our senior design project at Texas A&M where we constructed and implemented a greenhouse with smart technology.

*The university purchased all aspects of the project and chose to reuse them for future classes and because of this, our project no longer exists as it was when we were working on it. For the app, we used a temporary online database that we no longer keep up with, so all data used during testing and the final submission no longer exists. Also, because the app can no longer connect to the database, it is unusable and cannot be demonstrated.*

It was our job to come up with a way to make growing plants in a greenhouse eaiser for those that didn't have time to continually monitor them, or for those who couldn't handle the physical labor. This project employed smart technology which could monitor the growing conditions of the greenhouse and change the temperature, soil moisture, and light according to the user's preferences, or suggested conditions. 

For this project, we used an Arduino Micro Controller and a Raspberry Pi in a "master-slave" configuration. The Raspberry Pi connected to the database and pulled the data needed to set the thresholds for the sensors. It then relayed the data to the Arduino which used it to control the functionality of the actuator.
